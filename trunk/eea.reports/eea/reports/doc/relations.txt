Overview
========

The following relations can be defined for reports:
 - Is part of;
 - Has part;
 - Is replaced by;
 - Replaces.

''Is replaced by'' and ''Replaces'' is more important relations. They refer to
some kind of versioning or publications. In the new CMS these relations can be
done by assigning the report to same "group". Then the versioning is dynamically
calculated. E.g. if a report A is published after report B, and they both belong
to same group, then Report A replaces Report B and a message on the report B
will appear saying "Please note, a new version is available see Report A."

Group relations
===============

Imports

    >>> from p4a.subtyper.interfaces import ISubtyper
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> subtyper = getUtility(ISubtyper)

Add some reports

    >>> self.loginAsPortalOwner()
    >>> _ = self.folder.invokeFactory('Report', 'myreport_1')
    >>> _ = self.folder.invokeFactory('Report', 'myreport_2')
    >>> myreport_1 = self.folder.myreport_1
    >>> myreport_2 = self.folder.myreport_2
    >>> form = {
    ...   'publication_groups': ['Sample Group 1',],
    ...   'effectiveDate': '11/11/2008',
    ... }
    >>> myreport_1.processForm(values=form, data=1, metadata=1)
    >>> form['effectiveDate'] = '11/11/2007'
    >>> myreport_2.processForm(values=form, data=1, metadata=1)

Let's get in relation

    >>> from eea.reports.relations.interfaces import IGroupRelations
    >>> relations_1 = IGroupRelations(myreport_1)
    >>> relations_2 = IGroupRelations(myreport_2)
    >>> back = relations_1.backward()
    >>> back[0].getId
    'myreport_2'
    >>> forward = relations_2.forward()
    >>> forward[0].getId
    'myreport_1'

Let's see what happend if we don't have an effective date, it should use
creation date.

    >>> _ = self.folder.invokeFactory('Report', 'myreport_3')
    >>> myreport_3 = self.folder.myreport_3
    >>> dummy = form.pop('effectiveDate', None)
    >>> myreport_3.processForm(values=form, data=1, metadata=1)
    >>> relations_3 = IGroupRelations(myreport_3)
    >>> forward = relations_1.forward()
    >>> forward[0].getId
    'myreport_3'
    >>> back = relations_3.backward()
    >>> back[1].getId
    'myreport_2'
