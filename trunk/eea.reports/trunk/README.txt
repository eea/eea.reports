Overview
--------

The EEA Reports Product can be used to organise printed publications that are
available online for download. Such Reports usually have a publication
date, order and ISBN numbers, an author and exist in several language versions.

This package came out as an extension of slc.publications developed by
Alexander Pilz and if slc.publications allow you to subtype file-type contents,
eea.reports allow you to subtype folderish content.

Once stored in the Report Product, they can be displayed using
autogenerated overviews.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to get eea.reports support in Plone 4 using this package is to
work with installations based on `zc.buildout`_.  Other types of installations
should also be possible, but might turn out to be somewhat tricky.

To get started you will simply need to add the package to your "eggs" and
"zcml" sections, run buildout, restart your Plone instance and install the
"eea.reports" package using the quick-installer or via the "Add-on
Products" section in "Site Setup".

  .. _`zc.buildout`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/
  
You can download a sample buildout at:
 
  http://svn.eionet.europa.eu/repositories/Zope/trunk/eea.reports/buildouts/plone4/


Dependencies
------------

  * Optional: pdfinfo to parse pdf metadata (part of the xpdf package).

    yum install xpdf (fedora)
    apt-get install xpdf (debian)

  * Optional: pdftk and ImageMagick (6.3.7+) convert to generate a
    cover image from a pdf file.

    yum install pdftk (fedora)
    apt-get install pdftk (debian)

    yum install ImageMagick
    apt-get install imagemagick
