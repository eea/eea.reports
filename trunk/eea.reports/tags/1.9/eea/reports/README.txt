Reports Product

  The Reports Product can be used to organise printed publications that are
  available online for download. Such Reports usually have a publication
  date, order and ISBN numbers, an author and exist in several language versions.

  This package came out as an extension of slc.publications developed by
  Alexander Pilz and if slc.publications allow you to subtype file-type contents,
  eea.reports allow you to subtype folderish content.

  Once stored in the Report Product, they can be displayed using
  autogenerated overviews.
